This means you should get about 45 to 65 percent of your total daily calorie intake from carbohydrates.",

As a result, eating too much fiber may affect ovulation, making periods late or causing you to skip them altogether. But not all research supports this idea. Some studies have found no effect of fiber on ovulation and menstrual periods. Experts recommend getting 25 to 30 grams of fiber per day.",
